"""
Adversarial tests for the Narrative Assistant.

This package contains tests designed to BREAK the current algorithms,
exposing edge cases and weaknesses that need to be addressed.

These tests are inspired by GAN-style adversarial training where
one agent tries to find inputs that break the model.
